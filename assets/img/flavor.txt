:stack
The Void

We draw cards from this stack to reach further into the darkness.

:wands
Can be placed on SHIP.

:char

:char2

:vacuum
Space devoid of matter. Though tranquil it appears there is nothing here.

:planet
A dot on the viewscreen. We might explore here if we have time.

:planetoid
A dot on the viewscreen. We might explore here if we have time.

:asteroid
A dot on the viewscreen. We might explore here if we have time.

:sitea
We discovered an area that might hold resources. Place a crewmember here to retrieve them.

:origin
With this system receding into the distance we feel elated but anxious.

ðŸ”¥ Nothing immediate will happen once this card expires, but we might be able to salvage some resources while still in reach.

:ship
This stolen freighter was once used to transport 'perishables'.

ðŸ”¥ Place FUEL on this card to generate WAYFINDING.

:signal
This unrelenting waveform propagates through interstellar void. It is finely tuned to the failsafe algorithm embedded in our DNA.

ðŸ”¥ If this ticks to ZERO we will perish. We increase the timer by adding WAYFINDING. Or perhaps there is another way?
