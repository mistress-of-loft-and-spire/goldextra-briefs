:planet
On the viewscreen the solar system recedes into the distance. Having escaped this void you feel elated but anxcious.

⏳ Nothing immediate will happen once this card expires, but you might be able to salvage some resources while still in reach.

:ship
A junker stolen from a freeport. This freighter was once used to transport 'perishables'.

:signal
This unrelenting waveform propagates through interstellar void. It is finely tuned to the failsafe algorithm embedded in your DNA.

⏳ If this ticks to ZERO you will perish. Keep increasing the timer by adding TRAVEL or FUEL. Or perhaps there is another way?
